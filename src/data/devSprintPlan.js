    notes: "When grow room sensors are installed, feed data into Firestore. Auto-adjust harvest window estimates based on actual environmental conditions. Alert if conditions deviate from optimal range. Build when mushroom or Harvest Today grow rooms are operational.",

    status: "not-started",
    priority: "low",
    dueDate: null,
    notes: "Only needed when you have 6+ months of order history and 20+ regular customers. Until then, simple 4-week averages work fine. Would require a Python backend (Firebase Cloud Functions or separate service). Defer until data volume justifies the complexity.",

    status: "not-started",
    priority: "low",
    dueDate: null,
    notes: "PWA covers 95% of the native app experience. Build native wrappers only if: (1) push notifications don't work well enough via PWA, (2) customers specifically request App Store presence, (3) you need device features PWA can't access. Capacitor wraps the existing React app — not a rewrite.",

    status: "not-started",
    priority: "low",
    dueDate: null,
    notes: "Extend batch tracking to support mushroom-specific workflow: inoculation → incubation → pinning → fruiting → harvest → rest → re-fruit. Track flush number (1st, 2nd, 3rd) with declining but profitable yields. Build when mushroom production actually starts. cropConfig already has mushroom varieties defined.",

    status: "not-started",
    priority: "low",
    dueDate: null,
    notes: "Auto-push revenue and expense data to accounting software. Use QuickBooks Online API or Xero API. Build when the volume of transactions makes manual bookkeeping painful — probably around 50+ orders/month. Firebase Cloud Function triggered on new revenue/expense entries.",

    notes: "Print barcode labels for trays. Use phone camera as barcode scanner (browser API or library like quagga2). Scan tray → auto-match to order → mark as packed. Reduces errors by 40% per industry data. Viable for restaurant orders (low tray count). For bulk freeze-dry orders (14K trays), use Virtual Batching (rack units) instead.",

    notes: "Advanced inventory visibility. Instead of just showing current stock, query active batches where estimatedHarvestStart <= requestedDeliveryDate. Show chefs: 'In stock now' + 'Available by [date]' quantities. Prevents overselling and gives chefs confidence in ordering. Build after production tracking has 2+ weeks of real data.",
